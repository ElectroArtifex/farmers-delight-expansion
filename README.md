# Kacey's Mod
This is a mod made while I am learning Java.

This mod adds new weapons (such as the lightweight low damaged smallsword) and a variety of blocks (such as bricks variants to the polished andesite, diorite and granite) to the game.

This mod also makes the grass block grass on all sides and makes the water much clearer.

This mod will be great for all the builders out there who wants more variety of blocks.
